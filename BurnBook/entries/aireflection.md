## My project
- I chose my project to be coding with Ai.
- The project was very confusing and kind of frusturating.

I HATE AI im so scared that one day it will take over the world so I try to be polite to it but its stupid. I had to restart making the game three times. I wnted it to be lucy but it really didnt know how to do arms properly. I wanted to make the frog game a little harder but it was very gimicky. I wanted the game to end after 100, but the game just wouldnt work everytime I tried. I know now how difficult it is to make Ai work the way i want it to. I hate it.
